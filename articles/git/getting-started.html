<h2>Getting Started with Git</h2>
<br/>
<h4>What is Git and why should I use it?</h4>
<p>Git is a decentralized version control system, a tool to help groups or indiviuals manage changes to a project over time.</p>
<p>Git is important to use because it provides a full history of all changes made to a project over its lifetime and allows you to rollback to older states.</p>
<p>Version control systems and more specifically Git, are used in almost every professional development environment so it is a super important tool to know how to use before you join one of these workplaces.</p>
<p>The links in the sidebar will get you started with the basics of Git and provide references for further learning.</p>
