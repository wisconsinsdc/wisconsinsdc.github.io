    Resume Tips
</h2>
Here are some tips for building your resume. These are paraphrased from Gayle Laakmann McDowell's famous <i>Cracking the Coding Interview</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Keep the length to 1 page or less. If you have decades of experience 1 - 2 pages is acceptable.</li>
    <li>Only include work history relevant to the position you are applying for, things that make you seem more impressive.</li>
    <li>For each bullet point discuss your accomplishments during your employment with the general format "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z."</li>
    <li>Include 2-4 of your most significant projects. State what the project was and what languages/technologies you used.</li>
    <li>Independent/projects done in your personal time are more impressive than projects done for a class.</li>
    <li>Don't add too many projects/small or insignificant projects.</li>
    <li>You can list your skills/languages you know but be careful because listing those things makes them open game for interview topics. You may want to list your level of proficiency next to each skill/language.</li>
</ul>
